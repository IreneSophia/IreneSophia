Hello, I'm Irene Sophia and I'm a PhD candidate of the Berlin School of Mind and Brain as well as a fellow of the Einstein Center for Neurosciences Berlin. My doctoral project investigates the influence of motherhood on different processes of social understanding. But I'm also really interested in Data Science and more broadly how we can extract information from datasets! You can find more details on my interests and findings on my homepage: irenesophiaplank.com
