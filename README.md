Hello, I'm Irene Sophia Plank and I'm an MSCA global postdoctoral fellow at the NEVIA group led by Prof. Christine Falter-Wagner at the LMU Klinikum in Munich and the HAVIC lab led by Nathan Caruana at Flinders University in Adelaide. I'm interested in social understanding of other's in the brain and how it is influenced by our life experiences, the person we want to understand and the context. My current research focuses social interactions in virtual reality. Additionally, I'm doing research on social cognition and social interaction in neurodevelopmental disorders. 
 
I finished my PhD at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2022. As a PhD candidate, I was affiliated with the Berlin School of Mind and Brain as well as the Einstein Center for Neurosciences Berlin. My supervisors were Prof. Felix Bermpohl and Prof. Isabel Dziobek. My doctoral project investigated the influence of motherhood on empathy and mentalising, also called theory of mind.
