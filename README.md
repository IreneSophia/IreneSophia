Hello, I'm Irene Sophia Plank and I'm postdoctoral researcher at the NEVIA group led by Prof. Christine Falter-Wagner at the LMU Klinikum in Munich. I'm interested in social understanding of other's in the brain and how it is influenced by our life experiences and the person we want to understand. My current research focuses on cases where two interaction partners can be more or less "in sync". Additionally, I'm focusing on social cognition in neurodevelopmental disorders. 
 
I finished my PhD at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2022. As a PhD candidate, I was affiliated with the Berlin School of Mind and Brain as well as the Einstein Center for Neurosciences Berlin. My supervisors were Prof. Felix Bermpohl and Prof. Isabel Dziobek. My doctoral project investigated the influence of motherhood on empathy and mentalising, also called theory of mind.
